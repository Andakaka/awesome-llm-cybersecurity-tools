# Awesome Large Language Model Tools for Cybersecurity Research

## Reverse Engineering

<!-- should we have a "### Developed by Tenable" subsection here? -->

- [G-3PO: A Protocol Droid for Ghidra](https://github.com/tenable/ghidra_tools/tree/main/g3po): An AI assistant developed by Tenable for analysing and annotating decompiled code in Ghidra, which queries OpenAI and/or Anthropic's language models. See [this writeup on the Tenable tech blog](https://medium.com/tenable-techblog/g-3po-a-protocol-droid-for-ghidra-4b46fa72f1ff) for details.
- [ai for Pwndbg](https://github.com/tenable/pwndbg/blob/dev/pwndbg/commands/ai.py): Your trusty AI debugging sidekick, developed by Tenable as a Pwndbg command.
- [ai for GEF](https://github.com/tenable/gef-extras): Same as above, but implemented as a GEF command.

<!-- Not by Tenable -->

- [Gepetto](https://github.com/JusticeRage/Gepetto): An IDA Pro plugin that queries GPT models for explanatory comments and meaningful variable names (like G-3PO for IDA Pro).

## Network Analysis

- [BurpGPT](#need_repo_link): A BurpSuite plugin, developed by Tenable, that uses GPT to analyse HTTP requests and responses.

## Cloud Security

- [EscalateGPT](#need_repo_link): Uses GPT to discover privilege escalation vulnerabilities in misconfigured Identity Access and Management (IAM) policies for AWS.
